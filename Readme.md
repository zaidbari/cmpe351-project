This project was created by Muhammad Zaid Bari for Operating SYstems CMPE351 course and submitted to **Dr Devrim** HOD for computer science department of **Cyprus International University**. 
This project was intended to run on Linux/GNU POSIX environment.

### Objectives:
To write a program that simulates the service of jobs (process) by the
CPU of a multi-user computer.
Inputs should be taken from text file with command arguments. And results also
should be written to output file and screen.

#### Rules
- The application must be written in C/C++ programming language and must
be compiled on GNU/Linux Operating Systems.
- Don’t use any special library for protocols when coding. Write your own
functions if it’s necessary. Only exemption is data structure functions that
given in Data structures lecture.
- You should commit changes on github system. Usually at least one time a day
you should commit your code on github.


### Compilation command
``` cmd 
g++ -o cpe351.exe hello.cpp 
```


### Run command
``` cmd
./cpe351 –f input.txt –o output.txt
```
